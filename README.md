# FirelandsCore

## Build Status

4.3.4

## Introduction

FirelandsCore is a _MMORPG_ Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from _MaNGOS_ and _TrinityCore_, the _Massive Network Game Object Server_, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
